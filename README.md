RCROutlineButton
================

An iOS `UIButton` subclass with an outline border whose colour matches that of the title label.

## What it Depends on

`RCROutlineButton` has been verified as working with Xcode 6.1, iOS 7.1 and iOS 8.1.

All code uses ARC.

## How to Use it

The simplest way to use `RCROutlineButton` is with Interface Builder.

Drag a regular `UIButton` out into your view and then, using the Identity Inspector, set the button’s class to be `RCROutlineButton`.

If you want to customize the button’s corner radius and border width, you can do this using the corresponding fields in the Outline Button section of the Attributes Inspector.

Examples of using `RCROutlineButton` with Interface Builder in this way can be seen in the sample project.
